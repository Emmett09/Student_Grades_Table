# Student_Grades_Table
A table containing the grades of students. New rows and columns can be added with the buttons to create more students and assignments, and rows and columns be deleted with the buttons. The reset button will reset to the initial state. All cells except for the headings are editable. New assignment columns are automatically named. Each unfilled cell has a placeholder, and following interaction, missing grades are highlighted in yellow and a warning displayed with the number of missing grades below. Averages are automatically calculated when a user begins typing grades. An average of 60 or less is highlighted in red, and anything over is not highlighted. An attempt to type an invalid grade resets to the placeholder. An attempt to edit the average will reset to the true average. The display of the average grade can be changed from percentage to a letter to a decimal and back by clicking the heading of the Average column.
